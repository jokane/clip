Clip
====

This is a library for manipulating and generating short video clips.

It can read video in any format supported by ffmpeg, and provides abstractions
for things like cropping, superimposing, adding text, trimming, fading in and
out, fading between clips, etc.  Additional effects can be achieved by
filtering the frames through custom functions.
