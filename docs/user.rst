These are the parts of the library most likely to be useful to users.
Most are functions that return a Clip object [#f1]_; others are for saving or
previewing completed clips.

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 1

   _user/*

.. [#f1]
   More accurately: Some of these are classes and some are functions, depending
   on the details of their implementation. But that distinction seems to be
   irrelevant for most purposes --- it's generally safe to pretend that all of
   these are functions that return clip objects.
