        # blends "real" pixels with the background zeros around the edge of the
        # real image.  This is sort of built in if we rotate when there are
        # "real" pixels close to [0,0,0,0] background pixels.
        # 2. It gives straight lines a jagged look.
        #
        # Perhaps a better version might someday get the best of both worlds by
        # embedding the real image in a larger canvas (filled somehow with the
        # right color -- perhaps by grabbing from the boundary of the real
        # image?), rotating that larger image with INTER_LINEAR (creating an
        # ugly but distant border), and then cropping back to the radius x
        # radius size that we need.
