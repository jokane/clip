"""
This is a library for manipulating and generating short video clips. It can
read video in any format supported by ffmpeg, and provides abstractions for
things like cropping, superimposing, adding text, trimming, fading in and out,
fading between clips, etc.  Additional effects can be achieved by filtering the
frames through custom functions.
